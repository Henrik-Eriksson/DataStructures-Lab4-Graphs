# DataStructures-Lab4-Graphs
Lab 4 in Data Structures is about implementing a program to calculate the shortest path between cities using graphs. The task involves:

* Representing a road map as a weighted directed graph, with cities as vertices and roads as edges.
* Applying Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate shortest paths between cities.
* Using a min binary heap for the priority queue in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

Students are required to implement interfaces for graph ADT and priority queue ADT as defined in provided header files, and a main function. The graph is represented using an adjacency list, and the priority queue functions are similar to those from Lab 3, but with modifications to represent road distances. The output should show the shortest path distances from a given starting city, as in the provided example.
